Group project for our software dev class.

Either download the repository files or use 'git clone https://github.com/MaconHolliman/TallyTracker.git'

Once in the directory of the project, where you can see the folders for client and server, you want to run the following commands.

cd server npm install npm start

With that window opening and running, you'll want to open another prompt/commmand line etc and do

cd server npm install gulp

with those two running successfully, you can connect to the website via localhost:4000

You can edit the files in the client folder and when you save the file, it should get auto detected by gulp and auto refresh the website and allow you to view your changes immediately.
